### Current Work at Erwaskor  
At **Erwaskor**, I am currently working on a **DLC for the game _Yandere Commando_**.  
This project is set in **Oberhof, Thuringia, during the 1980s**, and I am contributing by creating (or at least trying to create!) the **3D models** that bring this immersive setting to life.  

It is both a challenging and exciting task, combining historical atmosphere with creative design for an engaging gaming experience.
